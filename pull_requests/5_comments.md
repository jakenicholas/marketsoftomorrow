A few more issues to fix based on the updated screenshot:

1. Cities sorting button is falling off the edge of the sidebar. The right side of that button should align vertically with the "X" button above it.
2. Change "All Dates" placeholder to "Delivery".
3. "All Types" looks a little too long - please shorten this text.

These are additional refinements to the filter layout that need to be addressed along with the original requirements.
